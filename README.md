# Apalevich Website monorepo

## Structure
The project is structured into several parts, where each directory represents its own project located on its own domain.

- `/general` directory:
This directory contains the source code for a personal website. It includes Astro files for the layout and components of the website, and a README.md file with instructions for setting up the project.
Represents [apalevich.com](https://apalevich.com)

- `/mate` directory:
This directory contains the source code for the MATE landing page. It includes TypeScript files for defining the content and structure of the landing page, and Astro files for the components used in the page.
Represents [mate.apalevich.com](https://mate.apalevich.com)

Each directory contains its own set of files and subdirectories.

*TLDR: the project combines a landing page for MATE and a personal website.*
